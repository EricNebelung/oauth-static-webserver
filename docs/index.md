# Welcome to OAuth Static Webserver

**Disclaimer:** This project is currently in an early development stage and is only intended for testing and educational purposes. It is not yet production-ready.

The OAuth Static Webserver is designed to serve static web content while providing protection trough OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication and authorization.
It can serve multiple sites with different configurations (e.g. different OIDC providers or access rules) simultaneously.
The main goals of this project are the ease of use and simple configuration while providing decent level of security and logging.

To getting started, please refer to the [Installation](installation.md) and [Configuration](configuration.md) documentation.
